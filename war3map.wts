Ok so, the name? Doesn't really roll off the tongue, and as I was making this tower, I'm not even sure if the name fits, but oh well.  He will be refered to as DeadKratos from here on forth.  DeadKratos doesnt seem that great for such a high cost and being an ultimate, but think again cause you go something in store.  His speed is well faster than the F/H though range isn't that different.  Another thing to watch out for is his damage, which is WAYY better than the Bishop but still not worth the money.  The good thing? He would cut off limbs if it would make him fight more.  Which means he can hit up to 100 enemies, more than 3x more than the F/H.  Not only that, but he can hit air too, making him a great anti air tower against more spread out spawns.

The Blade Alliance is a great anit-air race that can rival High Elves in later levels.  Start off with some footblades, and slowly maze.  The fact that this race has no splash means that you MUST maze.  But thats ok as your starting tower is much more powerful than other starting towers.  Just cotinue upgrading your towers as the rounds go on and you should stop from leaking.  The ultimate, BladeMastur, is a VERY powerful tower.  When used with buff towers, every damage added will be an ADDITIONAL 300.  When used in a maze, one blademastur can completely decimate the boss or destroy any air.  With his critical, he can do 2-3600 damage to air, which is basically half of level 30s hp.  And also, his cooldown is just crazy, meaning he can rip through several air spawns by himself in a manner of seconds.

Bandits are not that great for you if you know you want the highest score, but this race is very powerful when used in combination with a second race.  Start off with several bandits.  Cotinue mazing until you can get a jailor, which can steal gold.  From than on, you can basically work your way through the steals until you get Brandon.  Brandon doesnt seem to great, but he can steal wood from champs, which means by round 19, you can be getting a second race to stop the leaks.  I suggest a ground race such as Hydra and than an Air race such as Blade Alliance or high elves.

Ice Trolls are a very powerful race if used correctly.  The first tower has a slight slow, which makes this race very useful in dealing with bosses and champs.  Beserkers are great near spawns with their splash and slowing.  If you are at a spot where your spawn is really close, try getting several beserkers and a warlord.  If you can, get a High priest which does incredible amounts of damage to 1 target and splashes.  The War Mage is another great tower, and is great in a maze for dealing large amounts of damage.  The Grand mage can be properly used  when lots of creeps are running directly towards it, dealing not as much damage as the war mage but can hit more.  The other towers, such as the trapper, are great against champs and bosses.  The trapper has a 5 second stun with a 1 second cooldown, which is basically a perma stun.  When used with a priest, you can basically own 1 boss.  The shaman, is even better than the priest, dealing more damage and slowing while casting cyclone.
